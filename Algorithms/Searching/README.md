# ⚙️ Algorithms

✨ This folder contains **implementations and detailed explanations of algorithms taught in the Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) course**.

📄 Along with clean and well-structured code, it includes **PDFs and notes** that explain:
- 🔹 How each algorithm works
- 🔹 Iterative and recursive approaches
- 🔹 Time complexity analysis
- 🔹 Space complexity analysis

🎯 Designed for **learning**, **revision**, and **interview preparation**.
